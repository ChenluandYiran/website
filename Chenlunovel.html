			<h1 align="center">&#x1f497;How I Met My Husband&#x1f497;</h1>
			<p>My husband, JiuJian Ye, is an iOS developer working in New York City. He was born in a happy and harmonious family. </p>
			<p>Fate has brought us together – It is all written in the stars. The first time I met him was about nine years ago when we were both new freshmen to college, both the second-place owners in a Ping-pong competition, more coincidentally, we were even in the same major, same class, with same interests. He was such a sunny and thoughtful boy just like a prince charming from my perspective, I was obsessed to him quickly. We studied together during the week days and played together during the weekend. Gradually, we fell in love, it was the first love for both of us, sweet and romantic. Our campus love is one of the most precious memories in my life. We love each other purely, he saw me as treasures, I was spoiled like a little princess and the happiest girl in the world.</p>
			<p>
			However, at the year we finished our undergraduate study, Jiujian went to the US for further education. This was the first time we had to separate for such a long time, I felt upset and helpless at the beginning, especially the time I realized a firm hug could become an extravagant hope. Well, our true love can never be defeated, even the time and the distance. We missed each other so badly, even though we chatted on phone for several hours every day, it still seemed not enough. The temporary separation helped us realized how important and irreplaceable we were meant to each other, we cherished our relationship even more than ever before. During the days we were apart, without Jiujian’s meticulous care and company, I gradually became independent and mind grown. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Four years later, I received an offer from Tufts University and we finally gather together in the US. Four years is not a short period, things have changed a lot, but the only thing that never changed is our love. The first glance I saw him in the New York Airport, just like the first day we met in the college, I know that is my men, the sunny thoughtful men who treasure me even more than himself, the men I wish to spend rest of my life with.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the story, we eventually got married, live a happy life and will last forever.
